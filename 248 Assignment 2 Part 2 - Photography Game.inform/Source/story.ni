"248 Assignment 2 Part 2 - Photography Game" by Bjarke

[TO DO
 - DONE - introduction
 - DONE - room navigation guidance (descriptions like, to the east is the door to the kitchen)
 - DONE[?] working scene logic
 - DONE memory middle
 - DONE[MISSING examines] memory end
 - ending
 - do something with the picture (both the empty one and the one in the camera)
 - you can take the setting lol
 - should prolly have scene changes be greater than? just in case.

NICE TO HAVE
 - shelves and containers not saying what's in them until examined.
 - highlighting nouns to interact with (esp. in memories)

]



[SETUP]
When play begins:
	say "You close the door behind you, and put the key in your pocket. Here you are. Franks house. You used to be friends. You think perhaps you still are, but maybe sneaking into his house will be the end of that. But you haven't heard from him, even after writing every week for the past month, so now you're worried, too. You brought your camera, in case you need to remember the past. [line break] 
[italic type]Use the 'photograph' action, or 'p' to take pictures of objects in the house. You can then open the camera to view the memories that object triggers[roman type] [line break] "

The player is carrying a camera. "Your trusty camera."
Instead of dropping the camera:
	say "You're not letting go. It feels almost sewn onto your fingers."

camera tutorial is a truth state that varies.

Instead of opening the camera:
	if the player is not in Inside the Camera, move the player to Inside the Camera;
	if the camera tutorial is false:
		now camera tutorial is true;
		say "[italic type]There are memories from each part of your life, the beginning, middle, and end. The setting governs which ones you are seeing at the moment. There are more than 1 memory in each part, though, so stick around (and examine elements of the memories) to see the others.".

Instead of closing the camera:
	if the player is in Inside the Camera, move the player to Entrance;



[HOUSE]
The Entrance is a room. "The Entrance. The shoerack is the same, albeit a bit more dusty than you remember it. [line break]Further north is a living room, and up the stairs is a hallway above."
A shoerack is here. "One pair of shoes on the rack. Good as new."
A jacket is here. "A jacket hangs on the coathanger. It's his, you'd recognize it anywhere."

The Living Room is north of the Entrance. "The most prominent element in the living room his old dining table. Behind it are stacks of shelves. [line break]The east opens up to the kitchen. Back south is the entrance."
[]A supporter called a dining table is here. The description of the table is "You used to remember the story of how he got it. It was something to do with a misunderstanding. And a mistyped phone number."
[] A container called shelves is here. The description of the shelves is "Stacks of books. What looks like a project report. Opened letters. And one unmailed letter."
An unmailed letter is in the shelves. The description of the unmailed letter is "You open the unmailed letter. It's... empty. But addressed to you. The date? 3 years ago. You sigh. Guess he tried."
[]A picture is on the table. The description of the picture is "It is a picture of your friend, Frank. You don't remember taking this."
A project report is in the shelves. The description of the project report is "Our finals report. He really kept that. You can't even bear to flip through it. Too many things wrong with it."

The Kitchen is east of the Living Room. "A kitchen, just big enough for another person to squeeze by when one is cooking. The kitchen counters are clean. [line break]Back west is the living room."
The kitchen counter is scenery in the kitchen.
A set of knives is on the kitchen counter. The description of the set of knives is "He got those knives on one of his trips. Malaysia? Cuba? You don't remember. But he liked them."

The Hallway is up from the Entrance. "A short hallway, just big enough for two doors. One east, one west."

The Bedroom is east from the hallway. "His bedroom. It's very sparse. [line break]Back west is the hallway."
A book is here. "A book is on the nightstand." The description of the book is "some sci fi book you haven't heard of. But it's very much a thing he'd read."
A container called a diary is here. The diary is lockable. It is locked. 

Instead of examining the diary:
	if the diary is locked:
		say "His diary? Did he keep a diary? In any case, it's locked, so there's no way to know without a key.";
	otherwise:
		say "With slight trepidation, you open the diary. Why are you doing this? You flip through the pages. It's not super well kept. Entries every... third week or so? First entry is a couple years after school. You flip through some more, all the way to the last page. Dated... 2 months ago. [line break]
[italic type]Excited about going to Cyprus tomorrow. Gonna be good to get away for a while. [roman type][line break]That's it. That's all it says. Shit."

[]A guitar is here. "An unplayed guitar is in the corner." The description of the guitar is "Unplayed is harsh, perhaps. He played it once or twice. Always said he'd pick it up again. You don't remember seeing him ever do."

The Guest Room is west from the hallway. "It's the same guest bed he always had. It was always mildly uncomfortable. But you could never get yourself to tell him. [line break]Back east is the hallway."
[]A potted plant is here. "A potted plant is on the windowsill. It's... pretty dead."

Instead of examining the potted plant:
	say "Upon closer inspection, it is still dead.";

The brass key unlocks the diary. The brass key is inside the potted plant.
Before taking the brass key, say "(rummaging your hands through the potted plant, what a thing to do) you find the key in the mouldy earth."



There is a room called Inside the Camera. "Your vision is overtaken by dust and film. It smells like phosphor. Your body is weightless. As all good stories, this one has a beginning, a middle, and an end."
An empty picture is here. The empty picture is fixed in place. "An empty picture floats in the space." [should I do something with this? Is this the end condition?]


A setting is here. The setting is fixed in place. The setting is either beginning, middle, or end. It is beginning. "You feel as if you can change a setting, to change the time."

Changing is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "change [something]" as changing. 

Check changing:
	if the player is not in Inside the Camera:
		do nothing;
	if the noun is not the setting:
		do nothing;

Carry out changing:
	if the setting is end:
		now the setting is beginning;
		say "The world is beginning again";
	else if the setting is middle:
		now the setting is end;
		say "The world shifts to the end";
	else if the setting is beginning:
		now the setting is middle;
		say "The world shifts to the middle";

The exit is south of the Entrance. "Outside the house."

Instead of going to the exit:
	say "You leave the house.";
	end the story finally saying "Enough memories for one day." [fancy logic for what text to display here!]
	


[INSTEAD OF SCENES. if they don't work:
	have a timer variable that counts down if setting hasn't changed and player hasn't left camera. After 3 ticks, change to next part. That should work?]


[SCENE OBJECTS - these help fill in and ornament the scenes, but don't actually do anything.]
A teacher is scenery. The teacher is nowhere. The description of the teacher is "Clara Duvan, her name was. She was a good teacher. Got you through a lot."
The students are scenery. The students are nowhere. The description of the students is "There were too many for you to know them all well. You had some friends in there though. So did Frank."
The post-it notes are scenery. The post-it notes are nowhere. The description of the post-it notes are "They were his idea, mostly. You were never that organized. You tried to follow up, but your mind was always more chaotic than his."
A shoe is scenery. The shoe is nowhere. The description of the shoe is "It was about some disagreement over a figure, or something equally stupid. You wanted it, he didn't. It got heated, and the shoe sort of fell off."
A restaurant is scenery. The restaurant is nowhere. The description of the restaurant is "Italian? Maybe. Mediterranean? Frank had a knack for finding places you never really got. He kept saying he got them from his phone recommendations, but you never believed him. It felt too... well picked."
The work is scenery. The work is nowhere. The description of the work is "You got a job pretty quick after studies. Straightforward gig, really. Software engineer. Paid well. You still miss the coffee-machine from that place."
The text messages are scenery. The text messages are nowhere. The description of the text messages is "In hindsight... maybe there were more. But he also seemed busy. Or at least, you thought he was."
A bar is scenery. The bar is nowhere. The description of the bar is "Picked out by Frank, of course. A quiant little spot, close to our university. The prizes had gotten more expensive since we were students, but hey, now we had disposable income. For a while, at least."


[MEMORY SCENES]
[these are used to access the memories]
beginning access is a truth state that varies.
middle access is a truth state that varies.
end access is a truth state that varies.


[OOK maybe we should do it with Event Table instead? like in Day One [ยง10.4] - but i need to test how that works, first (can you examine during them?)]

You're sitting in the back, another 50 students or so, spread around the auditorium. It's new and too clean. The blackboard's barely been written on. [line break] 'You two, you're together', the teacher said. And you were, apparently. You had never met him before, but there you were, suddenly, forced to work together.

But the[otherwise]The[end if] talking is still good, though. You can feel the warmth, even all this time later. What happened to end it like this?"

Instead, you make a bad joke on how his plants didn't like him being away from home for that long. [end if]He asks how you're doing. You say 'fine.' And leave it there. He doesn't look satisfied, but doesn't pry."

[player gets fired!!]

When End Memory Part Two begins:

Was that what happened? [if the diary has been photographed]He said those things, really. Yeah. Maybe he was right.[otherwise]You told him what you thought, and that was that.[end if] But there was nothing about this fight, at the time, that said that this was the end. It was just a dumb scrap.

[oh a neat thing could be if a memory told you where he would hide a key, that you then find in the real world, to unlock his diary. or something.  ! ]

3 SCENES

Each scene has 3 steps - the steps are unlocked in the beginning but the descriptions are very vague/faint without the right items.
So that's
1:
	1, 2, 3
2:
	1, 2, 3
3:
	1, 2, 3

Nine Items to photograph.

Each scene of a different point in the life. 
meeting
turnaround
ending (last time I saw him)


Objects:
	shoerack
	jacket
	picture [of who?]

	a specific book
	a souvenir. a set of knives.
	an unmailed letter

	potted plant (dead)
	diary
	an unplayed guitar



other ideas:
	diagram or flowchart or project structure or project report! "oh, he kept this too??"
	dining table. some other friend or something? 

]



[is the gut punch that it's really You who's been neglecting Frank...? !!!!!]





[Photographing Rules]
A thing can be either photographed or not photographed. Usually things are not photographed.

Photographing is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "photograph [something]" as photographing. Understand "p [something]" as photographing.

Check photographing:
	if the player is in Inside the Camera:
		say "you have no hands with which to use an object you are inside. Even the sentence refuses to make sense." instead;
	if the noun is the camera:
		say "that makes no sense." instead.

Carry out photographing:
	say "*click*";
	now the noun is photographed;
	if the shoerack is photographed:
		now beginning access is true;
	if the jacket is photographed:
		now beginning access is true;
	if the picture is photographed:
		now beginning access is true;
	if the book is photographed:
		now middle access is true;
	if the set of knives is photographed:
		now middle access is true;		
	if the unmailed letter is photographed:
		now middle access is true;
	if the potted plant is photographed:
		now end access is true;
	if the diary is photographed:
		now end access is true;
	if the guitar is photographed:
		now end access is true;
[	if the shoerack is photographed and the shelves are photographed:
		move the memory of the university meetup to Inside the Camera.]


Report photographing:
	say "[the noun] is photographed. The camera whirs.";








[
[some every turn stuff - this will change]
Every turn:
	If the book is photographed:
		say "The book screams."; [This is not final, this was just a test]
[	If the memory of a shoerack is in Inside the Camera and the player is not in Inside the Camera:
		say "the camera smells like shoeshine".
	
]]

NOTES
instead of touching object: move to X

running multiple scenes simultaneously?


You could have the camera space be a copy of the house that you populate by taking photography. While inside you can trigger a scene that is incomplete depending on which items are missing.

score or something else just to keep track of how many memories the player has seen


STILL considering the idea that memories happen on turns when teh player is not there, so when they go into the camera, something new might happen than last time. but what memory? ALL of them? 


memories running on loop - multiple scenes.
running on loop in REAL TIME??

Linking like:
Train Stop is a recurring scene. Train Wait is a recurring scene. 
Train Wait begins when play begins. 
Train Stop begins when Train Wait ends. 
Train Wait begins when Train Stop ends. 




items unlock parts of the memory?

[OLD STUFFF]

[

[Two ideas for how to do memories]
[1: as objects]
A memory is a kind of thing. A memory is fixed in place. 

[ this examine rule doesn't work for some reason. DOCUMENTATION IS WRONG??
Before examining a memory, say: "Machinic sounds spin around you, as if the entire world is a giant clock. Then the memory forms in front of you."]

A memory called memory of a shoerack is nowhere. The description of the memory of a shoerack is "'Oh, you still got those?' His voice is hollow, but warm. 'Yeah,' I shrug. I had those old boots for another two years. He puts his shoes on the rack and walks into the living room. "

A memory called memory of the university meetup is nowhere. The description of the memory of the university meetup is "We always worked together well in university. Got assigned a random group in an early semester, but sometimes luck strikes true, no?"


[2: as scenes]
[
Jacket Memory is a scene.

Jacket Memory begins when the player is in Inside the Camera and the jacket is photographed.

When Jacket Memory begins:
	say "You remember when he bought the jacket. You were in London, visiting for the first time, and he got an idea that jackets were cheaper in Britain. He was wrong, but he insisted. You followed him, dutifully, shaking your head all the way. Although, you will admit, he got a pretty darn good jacket out of it."

[could have this space be actually simulated, and have the friend be a real person and have you move around in the memory. would be a lot more writing but would be an actual simulation.]
]

Shelves Memory is a scene.

Shelves Memory begins when the player is in Inside the Camera and the shelves are photographed.

When Shelves Memory begins:
	say "All the books. He kept all the books, the mad man. I sold mine after we were done."

[it DOES start both scenes at the same time. HMM]
